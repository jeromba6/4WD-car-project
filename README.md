# 4WD-car-project
## Introduction
I want to build a 4WD scale car that has 4 motors, one for each wheel. It will be controlled by a Arduino or Raspberry PI. The chassis will be Lego Technic.

The goal is to get it working and learn on how to control the motors including torque-vectoring, tank turn and when having enough confidence (and money to spend) convert a full size 4wd car in to an electric car with 4 in wheel hub motors.
## Investigation
Motors to use:
- Geared DC Motor with Encoder 1000 RPM 12V or 24V expected speed 0,1 - 20 km/h
- Brushless BLDC motor (More complex to control)
