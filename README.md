# 4WD-car-project
## Introduction
I want to build a 4WD scale car that has 4 motors, one for each wheel. It will be controlled by a Arduino or Raspbery PI. The chassis will be Lego Technic.

The goal is to get it working and learn on how to control the motors including torque-vectoring, tank turn and when having enough confidence (and money to spend) convert a full size 4wd car in to an electric car with 4 in wheel hub motors.
